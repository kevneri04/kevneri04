## Hi there 👋

I’m currently building a **Smart Mirror** that runs on **Linux**.  
The goal is a sleek, modular display for everyday info—time/date, weather, calendar events, and notifications—using a lightweight UI and easily swappable widgets.

## 🔭 Current Project: Smart Mirror (Linux)
- 🪟 Modular widget system (time, weather, calendar, system stats)
- 🖥️ Runs headless on a small form factor (think Raspberry Pi or similar)
- ⚙️ Auto-start on boot, minimal resource usage
- 🧩 Roadmap:
  - [ ] Add voice commands / hotword detection  
  - [ ] Integrate calendar + reminders  
  - [ ] Add music now-playing widget  
  - [ ] Theme switcher (light/dark)
 
## 🤘 Fun Facts
- 🏍️ I’m into **motorcycles**, riding, and tracking.  
- 🚗 Im also into **japanese cars**, from is300 to 240sx.
